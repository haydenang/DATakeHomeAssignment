### Assumptions
* id of task is generated by the DB and not user-specified
* PUT request will POST if the task with the specified id does not exist in the DB
* Account for basic Authentication for the API endpoints has already been created with the following details  
** username: test@testmail.com  
** password: password  
* The in-memory data store used to store the test task data will be uploaded to the DB on application start-up so all subsequent requests to the endpoints are interacting with the data in the DB and not in the in-memory data store.
